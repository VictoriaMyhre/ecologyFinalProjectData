This is solely meant to contain the compiled data and RStudio code for the final report in my ecology class.
If you do not understand the context of this data or code you are likely not the intended audience.
This data and code is being uploaded to github for the sake of reproducibility so that any who wish to see the data set as I have compiled it or the code as I have written it can do so.
Importantly, this code was not originally run in this one long block format. It was painstakingly tested, little syntax errors worked out, improperly generated plots redesigned, incorrectly used statistical tests replaced or altered.
I have solely compiled this code into one long block such that it can be copied and pasted into R or RStudio to show all of the results of the work I have done in greater detail than will be discussed in my paper.
If you are a student, naturally, please do not try and copy this and submit it as your own. I do not want to be responsible for anyone else's lack of integrity.
If you wish to use this as an example, though, from one person with a basic understanding of R code writing this out of a combination of a desire for thoroughness and personal pride, feel free to do so.
As I mentioned prior, the code is written for R. As far as I can recall, I do not use any code that would require installation of additional packages for R. If there are any, that is an oversight on my end after forgetting that I have installed them.
If you happen to be my professor for this course or someone else in this department, hello! I hope you enjoy looking at this and at the code I've written.
All of this being said, this is just a readme file and I have no idea what else to say here.
